**Worked on:** Built full Teero-like dental staffing landing page from scratch

**Changes made:**
- Customized theme in `src/index.css` — navy/blue/chartreuse palette replacing default shadcn neutral
- Created 7 landing page components in `src/components/landing/`
- Navbar with logo, nav links (For offices, For hygienists, About Teero), login/signup
- Hero section with heading, wavy SVG underline accent, subtitle, two CTA buttons
- HeroImage section with floating overlay cards (upcoming shift, earnings)
- FeatureWork section — "Work on your terms" with phone mockup placeholder
- FeatureHire section — "Fill your shifts" with team photo placeholder
- PlaceholderImage reusable component for prototype images
- Replaced boilerplate App.jsx with landing page composition
- Updated page title to "Teero - Dental Staffing"
- Updated docs/PRODUCT.md and docs/FEATURES.md

**Next steps:**
- Replace placeholder images with real photos/mockups
- Add footer section
- Add mobile hamburger menu for navbar
- Consider adding more sections (testimonials, pricing, how it works)
- Commit and push to GitHub

**Open questions:**
- What real images/assets will be used?
- Any additional sections needed beyond what's in the screenshot?
